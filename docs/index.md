# Welcome

Welcome to the [HIAS Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia oneAPI Classifier](https://github.com/aiial/hias-all-oneapi-classifier) official documentation.

&nbsp;

# Introduction

The **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) oneAPI Classifier** is an open-source classifier programmed using the  [Intel® Distribution for Python*](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/distribution-for-python.html) and trained using [Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow*](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html). The model is deployed on a Raspberry 4 using [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) and inference is carried out using the [Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 (Intel® NCS2)](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/hardware/neural-compute-stick.html).

# DISCLAIMER

_This project should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the project is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnostic systems._

_Although the model is accurate and shows good results both on paper and in real world testing, it is trained on a small amount of data and needs to be trained on larger datasets to really evaluate it's accuracy._

_Developers that have contributed to this repository have experience in using Artificial Intelligence for detecting certain types of cancer. They are not doctors, medical or cancer experts._
